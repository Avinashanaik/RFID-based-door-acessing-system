The concept of access control is brought about using a card, a corresponding card reader and a control panel interfaced with the server. The card is a proximity card with a unique identification number integrated in it. The reader reads the data and sends it to the control panel, which is the micro controller. This controller checks the validity of the data with the server, which bears the database. The control panel checks whether he/she is allowed to enter the particular door or not. If the employee is authentic, then he/she is allowed access in the particular entrance.
